      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">&nbsp;</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Bruce Bolt is a family-owned and operated company based in Austin, Texas, founded in 2017 by Bear Mayer, a 16-year-old baseball player. The company was born out of Bear's desire for better-quality batting gloves and the need for funds to purchase his first vehicle, a '93 Landcruiser named Jennifer. Inspired by his grandfather, Bruce, an exceptional athlete and baseball player, and driven by the mantra "Be Better," Bruce Bolt aims to create the highest quality, longest-lasting equipment in baseball, backed by excellent customer service. The company's name, combining "Bruce" with "Bolt," reflects both the influence of Bear's grandfather and the resilience and energy associated with being struck by lightning twice, a feat Bear's grandfather accomplished. Bruce Bolt distinguishes itself from competitors by focusing on quality over cost-cutting measures. Unlike many brands that prioritize synthetic materials and lower-cost production methods, Bruce Bolt uses premium leather and innovative designs to ensure durability and comfort. This commitment to excellence has attracted a wide range of customers, from youth and high school players to minor and major league athletes, with over 30 MLB and more than 150 minor league players currently using their products. As the brand continues to grow, it faces the challenge of scaling while maintaining its core values and commitment to quality. The company's journey began with Bear's frustration over the short lifespan of expensive batting gloves and evolved into a mission to create superior baseball equipment. With a focus on continuous improvement and a dedication to giving back to the baseball community, Bruce Bolt embodies the spirit of striving for excellence in every aspect of its operations, from product design to customer service.Bruce Bolt is a family-owned and operated company based in Austin, Texas, founded in 2017 by Bear Mayer, a 16-year-old baseball player.
